## About Waggle

Waggle is a pet care management application born from a real family's need. Inspired by a large family who loves their dog but struggled with coordination across different schedules, Waggle solves the common problem of miscommunication about daily pet care activities.

When multiple family members care for a pet, critical questions arise: Has the dog been fed? Did someone take them for a walk? Most importantly, has medication been administered? Missing or duplicating medication doses can be dangerous for beloved pets.

Waggle brings clarity and coordination to pet care, ensuring every family member stays informed about their pet's daily routine.
